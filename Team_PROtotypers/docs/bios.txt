Martin Holicka

My name is Martin Holicka, and I am a 3rd year Geomatics student at the University of Waterloo. I am passionate about solving problems and optimizing the solutions. I specialize in statistics-based spatial analysis and have had very successful projects in the past, most notably optimizing patrol routes of regional police cruisers with an average decrease in both time and distance travelled by more than 55%. Outside of school, I enjoy endurance mountain biking, triathlons, and skiing. I am looking forward to the challenges of the 2017 Esri Canada App Challenge.
