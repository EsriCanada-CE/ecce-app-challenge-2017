## Instructions
These are the instructions for submitting your work during the ECCE App Challenge. First, you should create a README.md Markdown file for your app ([this link will show you how to create a Markdown file](http://markdownlivepreview.com)).  The README file should state the goals of your app, and how to use it and deploy it.  For example, check out the [README file from last year's App Challenge winners](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2016/tree/master/Mapster).

In addition to the README file, the following items should be included in your App Challenge submission:

1. Mission statement for your app (i.e., what the apps seeks to achieve and why);
1. Statement of the characteristics of the app that make it appealing, interesting and useful  (i.e. how does it help the end user);
1. A video with voice over that demonstrates use of your app (can be a link to a YouTube video or a separate file); and
1. An organized code base suitable for upload to a GitHub code repository.

These deliverables are all included as criteria for the judging of your submissions, in addition to the reliability of your application (i.e., it must not be prone to crashing during use), and the quality of the user interface / user experience that it provides. 

Feel free to check out submissions from the App Challenge in previous years ([2015](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2015), and [2016](https://github.com/EsriCanada-CE/ecce-app-challenge-2016)), and refer to the App Challenge brief sent out at the start of the competition for further clarification on what include in your submission.  When you are completed your work for the App Challenge, upload a copy of the source code for your app and all of the required deliverables to folder using a file hosting service (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box), and email a link to the folder to [Michael Leahy](mailto:mleahy@esri.ca) before 5:00pm local time on the final day of the challenge.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
