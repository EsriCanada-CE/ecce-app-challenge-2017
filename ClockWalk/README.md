\#\# Mission Statement

The Vancouver Clock Walk fosters sustainable active living through urban
exploration.

\#\# Description

Our app, is designed to encourage people to go out and explore their city
through sustainable non-motorized transportation. The app works by showing
people how far they can walk from their current position based on a set time and
includes interesting nearby locations. By encouraging people to get outside and
learn about their community in small manageable stretches of time, our app not
only promotes active living but demonstrates how easy it is to move around the
city without motorized transportation.

\#\# How It Works

1.  Start the app by finding your location in Vancouver or click on the My
    Location Widget to zoom to your location.

2.  Next, click on the Draw widget, and draw a point over where you are.

3.  Then click on the Clock Walk Calculator (Analysis \> Create Drive Time Areas
    widget), from the ‘Choose point layer to calculate drive-time areas around’
    drop down, select the point you previously drew. Under ‘Measure’ select
    Walking Time, and then enter the amount of time you have for your walk, and
    click Run Analysis. This will create an area around the point you drew,
    which shows the points of interest that are reachable within your allocated
    time.

4.  To identify all of the points of interest in this area, click on the Query
    widget, and under the ‘Relate layer’ drop down, select the area you created
    from the Clock Walk Calculator.
