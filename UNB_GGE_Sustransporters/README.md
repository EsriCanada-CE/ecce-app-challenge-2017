## Welcome to the Transportation Calculator

---------------------------------------------
# Our Goal
 
To implement the idea of sustainable transportation to the Toronto public, based on the economic and environmental 
factors we are facing, it is important to rise the public's awareness that how much that everyday commute could affect our living
enviroment. This app was designed to be a user-friendly tool to help users find not only a efficient but also an eco way of commuting. 

---------------------------------------------

# How it works

This app has several widgets, each of them provides a specific function to help users to commute “green”. 

  * Direction
  * View Emissions by Vehicle Type 
  * Find Near By
  * Chart 
  * Where
---------------------------------------------
By clicking on the “Direction” button, it allows users to choose different commute types, i.e. bike, car, or walking. And by setting the Origin and 
Destination, the departure time and the transport type, a result on how the choice would affect his/her carbon footprint will show up.
Instead of just considering the fastest route, the users can also find a better of their trips in terms of saving energy and protect 
the environment at the same.   
--------------------------------------------- 
The “View Emissions by Vehicle Type” widget provide variety of car models options for a buying-new-car user to find the best choice for them. 
Which one has less fuel consumption (less money cost), less GHG emission (less air polluting)? Also based on the route the user has chosen in the previous step the amount of CO2 is going to emitted by his vehicle will be calculated.
---------------------------------------------
The "Find Near By" widget allows users to find firstly the Drive Clean Test Centres, which always remind the vehicle drivers to check their
car emission standards; secondly the bike supply and parking sports easily, which tells the users how easier their lives could be if riding a bike 
for their trip.
----------------------------------------------
The "Chart" widget shows the historic heavy traffic intersections. App users can use it as an reference to make their route dicisions
in advance before their departure. Based on the historic heavy traffic intersections chart, people either live in the city or just moved in can 
have an better idea of the city's overall traffic condition.
