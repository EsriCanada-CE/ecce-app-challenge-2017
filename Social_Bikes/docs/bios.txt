Sean Leipe

I'm a 4th year student in the Honours Earth and Environmental Science program at McMaster University, with a minor in GIS. I've been working on my undergraduate thesis with Patrick DeLuca, which involves evaluating susceptibility to badland encroachment in Italy using GIS and multicriteria evaluation. My main research interests at the moment are integrating traditional earth science work such as hydrogeology, geophysics, and geomorphology with GIS as I enjoy working in both fields and believe each adds value to the other when they are combined.
